# DAND-Term2-P2-Kickstarter-EDA
Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree's Term 2 second project: Explore and Summarize Data.

The goal of this project is to do Exploratory Data Analysis using R to find insights in
a dataset. I chose to use a Kickstarter dataset that I found on Kaggle to do my analysis.
The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects/home.

The analysis is broken up into the following 5 sections:
1. Pre-processing the Data
2. Univariate Analysis
3. Bivariate Analysis
4. Multivariate Analysis
5. Reflection

The analysis was done in R studio and then converted to HTML using the knitr library.
